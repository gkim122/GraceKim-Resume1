        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Grace Kim. I’m currently a second year attending University of California, Riverside. As of right now, I am a sociology major but I am hoping that I will be able to change my major into psychology. I’m completing my pre-requisites in order to change majors and hope that I will be able to do more hands on psychology internships. I do not have any professional internship or job experience but I am hoping to find my first soon and hope to learn more about my career path. I am bilingual, speaking both English and Korean, so I have no problem conversating or working in both languages. I have provided professional individual and family psychotherapy to all-aged patients with various emotional and/or behavioral disorders. Developed and implemented treatment plans and conducted comprehensive psychological evaluations. I monitored patients' progress and worked closely with other professionals to increase the quality and efficiency of treatment. Educated patients and their family members on mental diseases and disorders and treatment options. Attended and presented at various academic/non-academic conferences, such as TEDx Talk, The British Psychological Society's Annual Conference, European Congress of Psychiatry, Clinical College Conference. I would love to attend more conferences and hear of other opinions about my future major and work field. I have maintained an extraordinary patient satisfaction of 98%.<br><br>
